# Self Organizing Maps Ruby Library

This library was made in an effort, to better understand how the neural network algorithm Self Organizing Maps (aka SOMs) work.
It is written in pure Ruby, so it is easy to understand and extend.

### Geting Started

Just git clone this repo, and look at the bin folder, which is full of examples. 
If your prefer feel free to check the tests, in the spec folder.


All of this code was made during my master thesis, and is available under an MIT license :D
